## The main directory has three sub directories:

- **Scripts**: This directory has two jupyter notebook scripts.
    -  **SorghumSeedInference.ipynb**: This notebook shows a demo about segmenting seed images and extracting data related to seed shape and color. The notebook has all the information regarding the files required to run this notebook.
    -  **ManualAnnotation.ipynb**: This notebook shows how to get the ground truth data related to seed shape and color from ten manually segmented images. The notebook has information regarding the files required to run the script.
